# Longshot

Open-source performance tracker for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) traders.

Enter any Polymarket username or wallet address and see that account's open positions, closed positions, and PnL (realized, unrealized, and per-position). All data is public and read-only — no login, no wallet connection, no API keys.

## How it works

Longshot is a Next.js app whose server routes call Polymarket's public APIs:

- **Gamma API** (`gamma-api.polymarket.com`) — profile search (username → wallet address)
- **Data API** (`data-api.polymarket.com`) — open positions (`/positions`), closed positions (`/closed-positions`), portfolio value (`/value`)
- **Leaderboard API** (`lb-api.polymarket.com`) — all-time realized profit (`/profit`)

Requests go through the app's own server (not the browser) so lookups are shielded from CORS changes and can be cached at the edge.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. No environment variables or secrets are required.

### Analytics (optional)

Longshot supports [PostHog](https://posthog.com) product analytics. It's fully
optional — with no key configured, the tracking code is a no-op and nothing is
sent. To enable it, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set your own
project's values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# then edit .env.local:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_key
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com
```

`.env.local` is gitignored and must not be committed. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values
are inlined at build time, so they need to be present in the environment where
`npm run deploy` builds (not only as a Cloudflare Worker runtime variable). The
project API key (`phc_...`) is safe to ship in the browser; never commit a
Personal API key (`phx_...`).

### Accounts & auth (optional)

Longshot supports email accounts via [Supabase](https://supabase.com) — a
signup-first landing, 6-digit email OTP, and a linked Polymarket account per
user. It's fully optional: with no Supabase env vars set, the auth layer no-ops
and the public tracker works exactly as before (the landing keeps its search
box). To enable it:

1. Create a Supabase project (Data API on, auto-expose new tables off, automatic
   RLS on) and run [`supabase/migrations/0001_auth_schema.sql`](supabase/migrations/0001_auth_schema.sql)
   in the SQL Editor (creates `profiles` + `linked_accounts` with RLS).
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key>   # public, protected by RLS
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service role>   # SECRET — server only, never commit
   ```
3. For the OTP **code** email (not a magic link), configure custom SMTP in
   Supabase (e.g. [Resend](https://resend.com)) and edit the *Confirm signup* and
   *Magic Link* templates to include `{{ .Token }}`. Set the OTP length to 6.

The anon key is designed to be public; security comes from the RLS policies in
the migration. The service role key and any SMTP/Resend keys are secret and live
only in `.env.local` (locally) or as Cloudflare Worker secrets (production).

## Self-hosting

The app deploys anywhere Next.js runs. The included config targets Cloudflare Workers via [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare):

```bash
npm run deploy    # builds with opennextjs-cloudflare and deploys with wrangler
```

You'll need a Cloudflare account and `wrangler` authenticated (`npx wrangler login`, or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the environment). Adjust `wrangler.jsonc` to change the worker name or attach a custom domain.

## Roadmap

v1 is deliberately narrow: the tracker only. Planned for later phases, roughly in order:

- Calendar view of results
- Filters by market category, win-probability band, and time-to-resolution
- Strategy/scout screener
- Per-market chart view
- Kalshi support

## License and branding

The source code is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). The project
name, logo, wordmark, and other brand assets are **not** included in that
license — see [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md) and [brand/README.md](brand/README.md).
Forks and modified versions must use distinct branding and must not imply
endorsement or official affiliation.

To make rebranding easy, the name and wordmark are centralized in
[`src/config/brand.ts`](src/config/brand.ts) — forks change that file (and
replace anything under `brand/`) rather than hunting through the code.
